    <h4>August 2019 — Present</h4>
    <p>I led the merger of our combined products, customer experience, systems, culture, and

        Social media today is centered around sharing your experiences with your followers and
        “connecting” with people via digital engagement. As a result, people are consumed by their
        phones and using digital to replace real-life experiences. At Twenty our mission is to enable
        and enrich experiences by bringing people together. I own, manage, and coach our teams towards
        solutions which help bring people together by increasing moments of serendipity.
